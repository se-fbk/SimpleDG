./dotChecker <path/to/file.dot>
```
In the output folder you will find:
- number of nodes;
- number of edges;
- if the graph is a tree;
- if the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG);
- if the graph is complete.

> To complete the development of this program, I used online resources such as Stack Overflow to solve doubts and errors during the coding process. I also relied on ChatGPT initially to guide me on how to effectively solve the assigned task.
